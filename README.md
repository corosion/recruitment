## CredoWeb

#### Why a technical task?

At CredoWeb we use a variety of different technologies and we don't expect you to be aware of all of them! That's why we have prepared a simple task in order to show us the awesome engineering skills you have!

Here are some points that we tend to look for when reviewing your task:

- Quality (is it functional)
- Structure (code layout, abstraction, modularisation)
- Usability and design

#### The task

- [OMDb API](developer-omdb-task.md)
- [UI Developer]](developer-ui-task.md)

#### What to do after completing the task?

When you have completed the task, we would like you to send us a link to a Github/Bitbucket/Gitlab repository so we can review your work. The best way for us to test your task submission would be to host it (we don't care where) and provide us with a link. Dockerfile is always bonus points!

If you have any questions please do not hesitate to contact us. We are looking forward to seeing your awesome results.
