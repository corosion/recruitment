## Web Development UI Task

We at CredoWeb are always trying to improve the look and feel of our platform and a great UI Developer would help us bring that better experience to the end user.

Your task is to bring to "live" the provided PhotoShop file and create the actual web page based on the design.

### Tips and Help

.. and just a few pointers below for the task:

* HTML5 and CSS3 are a must!
* Focus on how well is implemented the grid system, alignment of elements and style of code
* Responsive site (mobile first!) is a priority
* You are free to use any CSS framework and/or pre-compilers such as Sass or LESS
* There is no need to implement the JavaScript functionality (Add More, Article Settings, etc) so they can be always visible
* No need to make the icons SVGs - images are just fine
*

If you feel like you want to show us what you're are really capable of, here is a list of potential enhancements that we have come up with. You can always go the extra mile and do not limit yourself to it if you think of any other possible feature enhancement that you want to include in your submission.

* WYSIWYG Editor implemetation (we use TinyMCE)
* Improve the speed of the page in terms of the images/content loading.
